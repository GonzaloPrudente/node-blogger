## How it works
Node Blogger is super easy to use once you have installed it as shown about.

Firstly you need to create new post:

newpost
````

This newpost command prompts you to enter the title of your post, categories for the post and date. Categories and date are optional.
A new markdown file is created with some placeholding text. You can find that file in the /posts directory, use it to write your post.


After you have finished writing your post in markdown format, create an html file by running the compile command.

```
# This command will compile all the new and modified markdown files to html
compile
```

Awesome! Now its time to share your blog with the would, let's fire up the server.

```
node server.js
```

That's all, happy blogging!
